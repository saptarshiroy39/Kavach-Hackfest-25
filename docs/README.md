## Overview

Project Hackfest-25 is a state-of-the-art security platform designed to detect, analyze, and respond to security threats in real-time. The platform leverages artificial intelligence for anomaly detection and blockchain technology for immutable audit logging.

### Key Features

- AI-powered threat detection and analysis
- Blockchain-based immutable audit logs
- Real-time security monitoring and alerting
- Multi-factor authentication (MFA)
- Comprehensive security dashboard
- Incident response automation

## Architecture

The platform follows a microservices architecture with the following main components:

1. **Frontend**: React-based web application with TypeScript
2. **Backend**: Node.js API server
3. **AI Models**: Python-based machine learning services
4. **Blockchain**: Ethereum-based immutable logging
5. **Database**: MongoDB for user and security event data
